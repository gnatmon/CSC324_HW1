                    I am a third-year computer science major at Stonehill College.
                    Aside from school, I work for Stonehill's IT department, and 
                    my family's healthcare business part-time. Get to know me! :

                    <h2> My Upbringing:</h2>
                        <p>
                            I was born in Brockton, MA, and I have lived in Brockton
                            my whole life. Growing up, I have always been involved in extracirrculars
                            and sports such as boxing, percussion instruments, and Basketball.
                            I graduated from Cardinal Spellman High School in Brockton in May 2022, 
                            and while there, I was a member of the basketball team 
                            and track & field.

                        <p>
                            In my spare time, I really enjoy listening to music, lifting weights, watching anime,
                            and creative writing. The video game series I really enjoy are Pokémon, Minecraft, The Legend of Zelda & Super Smash Bros.
                            Some of my favorite anime include Gurren Lagann, Bleach, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood & Naruto. 
                            I am working on a few creative writing projects, one of which I am writing a 
                            1st draft for that is about 20% finished. One of my 2026 resolutions
                            is to complete the draft, and so far working on it has been a joy!
