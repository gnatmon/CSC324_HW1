                <p>
                    Welcome to my project webpage, where I explain some of the personal and academic 
                    projects I have made. I will explain why I made each project, what each project
                    was designed for, and some projects I plan to start in the future.

                    <h2> Project #1: Active Directory Homelab</h2>
                        <p>
                        This project was a self-built Active Directory homelab that I did in order to simulate the day to day job of a Windows Sys Admin, 
                        to adequately prepare for internship opportunities & full time positions post grad. I used Oracle VirtualBox to configure a Windows 11 Server 
                        virtual machine as a Domain Controller, and deployed Windows client machines connected through an isolated virtual network following that. 
                        I installed and configured Active Directory Domain Services, created and structured Organizational Units, managed domain users 
                        and security groups, and joined client machines to my domain. I played around with and implemented Group Policy Objects 
                        to enforce user and computer policies, and performed day to day administrative tasks like password resets, unlocking accounts, 
                        and user lifecycle management. I also used PowerShell scripting to help me, by automating administrative tasks like
                        mass user creation. This project gave me some experience with domain infrastructure, network configuration, 
                        and troubleshooting domain join issues, which have not only been useful for my current role in IT, but will hopefully
                        make me a more appealing cantidate for sys admin internships & jobs.
